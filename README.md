# Introduction

This repository is used to try out Scala functionality as I read through a few Scala book.

The lessons follow what is presented in the book [Functional Programming,Simplified](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Simplified-Alvin-Alexander-ebook/dp/B076J7CJKY)

README will be updated with the lessons done as the journey to learn Scala continues.
